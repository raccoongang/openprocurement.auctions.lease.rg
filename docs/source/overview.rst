Overview
========

This `openprocurement.auctions.lease` package documentation contains information for Participants of the PROZORRO.SALE system and intended to discover all aspects of `lease procedure`.

*Please note that the documentation is currently somewhat out of date.*

In the Organizer role can act following subjects:
- `State Property Fund of Ukraine <http://www.spfu.gov.ua>`_;
- state enterprises;
- authorities, which are authorized by the Verkhovna Rada of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea;
- enterprises, institutions and organizations.

In order to perform state property lease specialized procedure is available:
 
 * `propertyLease` - lease of the state property.

Glossary
--------

* `Tender Procedure` - process which includes:
    - lease tender procedure initialization by an Organizer;
    - initial bids proposals by participants (Bidders);
    - auction (3 rounds);
    - qualification (awarding) - identifying of the winner;
    - payment;
    - contract signing;

Tender Procedure life cycle consists of following periods:
* `Organizer` - a representative of State Property Fund of Ukraine;
* `tenderPeriod` - the time period during which tender `bids` are accepting;
* `enquiryPeriod` - the time period during which participants can ask questions to clarify tender's terms;
* `rectificationPeriod` - the time period during which an Organizer can perform changes to tender terms;
    NOTE: `tenderPeriod` has to be minimum 5 days longer then `rectificationPeriod`.
* `auctionPeriod` - the time period of `auction` itself;
* `verificationPeriod` - the time period during which an Organizer identifies a winner;
    NOTE: as a result of verification process is auction `Protocol` (confirmed and downloaded by an Organizer).
* `paymentPeriod` - the time period during which Participant (Winner) performs payment;
* `signingPeriod` - the time period of downloading and activating of Contract by an Organizer;
    NOTE: every period has its `startDate` and `endDate`.
* `minNumberOfQualifiedBids` - minimum desired participants' count to consider procedure successful;
* `invalidationDate` - date when the last editing was made by an Organizer (initial bids invalidation occurs);
* `valid bid` - a bid which value is equal or greater then a value of `value.amount + minimalStep`;
* `CAV-PS` - the main classifier;
* `CPVS` - additional (secondary) classifier.

Features
--------

* The only currency (*Value.currency*) for this procedure is hryvnia (UAH).
* The only date Organizer has to provide is *Auction.auctionPeriod.startDate* (approximate Auction start date - actual value of Auction start will be calculated based on current system load). The rest will be calculated automatically.
* *tenderPeriod* must be at least 7 calendar days.

* Procedure can be switched from *draft* status to *active.tendering*.
* During *active.tendering* period participants can ask questions, submit proposals, and upload documents.

* The items within an auction are allowed to be from different CAV groups. There is predefined list of possible items to lease (please, refer to `CAV-PS` classification schema):
    - 04000000-8
    - 05000000-5
    - 06000000-2
    - 30000000-9
    - 31000000-6
    - 32000000-3
    - 33000000-0
    - 34000000-7
    - 35000000-4
    - 37000000-8
    - 38000000-5
    - 39000000-2
    - 42000000-6
    - 43000000-3

* Additional classification (CPVS) is constant for `propertyLease` procedure - `PA01-7`.
* The minimum desired participants' count by default is 2, but there is option to decrease it to 1 participant;
* Optionally an Organizer can set `tenderPeriod.endDate` - if so, auction can't start earlier 3 days after.
* Optionally an Organizer can set `enquiryPeriod.endDate`, if not provided - it will be calculated automatically.
* An Organizer can edit procedure only during *rectificationPeriod* (increase and decrease `value.amount`, `guarantee.amount`, `minimalStep.amount`).
* Organizer can add and edit documents only during *rectificationPeriod*.
* As soon as the action is edited, the status of all of the submitted bids will be switched to `invalid`.

* There is obligatory participant qualification via guarantee payment.
* The only criterion for choosing a winner is the price, provided the tenderer complies with the qualifying criteria determined by the Organizer.

Conventions
-----------

API accepts `JSON <http://json.org/>`_ or form-encoded content in
requests.  It returns JSON content in all of its responses, including
errors.  Only the UTF-8 character encoding is supported for both requests
and responses.

All API POST and PUT requests expect a top-level object with a single
element in it named `data`.  Successful responses will mirror this format. 
The data element should itself be an object, containing the parameters for
the request.  In the case of creating a new auction, these are the fields we
want to set on the auction itself.

If the request was successful, we will get a response code of `201`
indicating the object was created.  That response will have a data field at
its top level, which will contain complete information on the new auction,
including its ID.

If something went wrong during the request, we'll get a different status
code and the JSON returned will have an `errors` field at the top level
containing a list of problems.  We look at the first one and print out its
message.
